It will be marked as a virus by AVs, but that is just a false positive. It will vary by antivirus, but you should go into the settings of your AV and turn off "Real Time Protection", or create an exclusion and select NordPatcher.

After running NordPatcher once (while NordVPN is open on your computer), you can delete the file. Then you can reenable your AV.
